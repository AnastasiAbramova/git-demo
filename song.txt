I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God, it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home...
Sitting all alone inside your head
How do you feel, that is the question
But I forget you donâ€™t expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and
little notes
